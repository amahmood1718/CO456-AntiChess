# CO456-AntiChess
## Contributors: Ahad Mahmood and Diana Constantinescu

#### Language and Library Dependencies
Python3 is required to run this code. The python-chess library needs to be installed to run this code. Any remaining libraries used are built-in.  
The additional documentation under Sources has instructions on how to install the chess library.
  
The code runs on a Linux command terminal (such as Ubuntu 20.04). Once in the appropriate folder, just run:  python3 antichessbot.py white  
in which case the bot will play white and give the starting move, or run:  python3 antichessbot.py black  
in which case the bot will play black and the user will need to enter the starting move.  
All moves are in coordinate notation (eg. b2b3).
